# Basic Python Projects
 These are come projects I have created in Python. They use various models such as tkinter and sqlite3.

 ## Projects:
 - PhoneBook
 - Check Files GUI

 ### Phonebook
 This project functions as a phone book for a user. A user can enter and save contact information such as;
 a name, a phone number, and an email address in a database(sqlite3).
 A user can then update and delete previously stored entries from the database.

 ### Check Files GUI
 This project allows a user to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another.
 All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
